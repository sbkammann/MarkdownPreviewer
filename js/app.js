//When I enter GitHub flavored markdown into the #editor element, the text is rendered as HTML in the #preview element as I type

// one of each of the following elements: a header (H1 size), a sub header (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block, a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text.
//When my markdown previewer first loads, the default markdown in the #editor field should be rendered as HTML in the #preview element.
//When I click a link rendered by my markdown previewer, the link is opened up in a new tab (HINT: read the Marked.js docs for this one!).
